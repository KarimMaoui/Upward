  **Beyond Green: ESG as the Future of Business Leadership**
  
  Sustainability has evolved into a core business strategy. Today, Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) principles shape how companies raise capital, attract talent and build trust. In an era marked by climate change, social inequality and supply chain disruption, leading responsibly is no longer optional, it’s expected.
  
  For forward thinking businesses, ESG is not a checklist. It is a roadmap to future-proofing operations, mitigating risks and creating innovation. Investors are ever more scrutinizing ESG metrics, with over $30 trillion of sustainable assets under management worldwide (GSIA, 2023). Strong ESG performance is typically linked with better financial results, greater resilience and enhanced brand reputation.
  
  For example, Schneider Electric, a French multinational which incorporates ESG into its value chain. From net-zero targets to workforce diversity goals, it aligns sustainability with core business outcomes. Meanwhile, companies lagging behind can anticipate increased borrowing costs, regulatory fines and public confidence.
  
  Nevertheless, its enforcement is complex. Monitoring environmental impacts from global operations, requiring compliance among suppliers, or ensuring governance transparency requires data, collaboration and leadership. Greenwashing, a misleading portrayal of sustainability also remains a concern, prompting action for standardized ESG disclosure.
  
  Still, the direction is clear: ESG is becoming a baseline expectation. Whether it may be carbon reporting in Europe or DEI metrics in the United States, stakeholders are demanding accountability.
  
  At its core, ESG is about embedding purpose into business. When done right, it fosters trust, attracts capital and generates long term value, not just for shareholders, but for society.
  
  **Critical Thinking Questions:**
  1. Why is ESG now considered a strategic priority rather than a compliance obligation?
  2. How can strong ESG performance help a company attract investors and lower financial risk?
  3. What are the challenges in measuring ESG outcomes across multinational operations?
  4. How does Schneider Electric’s approach to ESG create competitive advantage?
  5. In what ways can greenwashing harm a company’s reputation and credibility?
  6. Why is standardized ESG reporting important for global businesses?
  7. What role does governance play in achieving real sustainability outcomes?
  8. How might ESG priorities differ between regions like Europe and the United States?
  9. Why should ESG be embedded into business strategy instead of treated as an add-on?
  10. How do ESG factors influence consumer trust and brand loyalty?

      "The Biggest Decline in U.S. Dollar Value, Precedents, and Where it Will Take Us",

  **The Biggest Decline in U.S. Dollar Value, Precedents, and Where it Will Take Us**
  
  Since 1971, the dollar’s appreciation and depreciation cycles, often closely tied to systemic imbalances that lead to major reallocations of resources, have been extended and distinct, and influence markets worldwide. In late 2024, the challenges of managing unsustainable interest payments were culminating into the glaring devaluation of the dollar that we've observed this year and are likely to keep witnessing on the second half of 2025.
  
  The current depreciation calls to mind past phases of depreciation such as the Bretton Woods agreements between 1973 and 1979, the Volcker shock of the 1980s, the Wake Plaza agreements from 1985 to 1995, and 2015 due to the sharp increase in oil prices, all triggered by financial events of global scale. Leading up to this past year, the U.S. economy's performance and dominance of financial markets has been considerably fueled by an aggressive fiscal spending policy relative to other countries' economies. This, combined with the American cost of debt and extreme government deficit to GDP, is an unsustainable path that pivoted the strength and value of the U.S. dollar.
  
  As of mid-July, Societe Generale reported that the dollar had fallen by an average of 9% against developed currencies, and 6% against emerging currencies, while Morgan Stanley published on early August that it's expected to devaluate an additional 10% during the second half of 2025 despite its 3.2% recovery in July. It reflects a lesser expected growth gap between the United States and the rest of the world, along with the negative pressure exerted due to the delayed impact of tariffs. The economic uncertainty caused by tariffs and policies of the current administration led to worries about growth, inflation, and public debt.
  
  The 2.4% U.S. growth experienced in 2024 is being followed by a 1.5% growth in 2025 and a projected 1% growth with interest rated lowered from the current 5.5% to 2.5% by the end of 2026. Failing to match comparable interest rates in the international market will increase the probability of the dollar weakening even further. This depreciation will most likely have an impact on individuals both within and outside the U.S., affecting consumers, businesses, and investors. For Americans, it will translate into higher expenses when traveling abroad or consuming foreign goods; and for those outside the U.S., it makes American assets less desirable and might lead to increased dollar selling, which would then devaluate its value even more. As of late May, the dollar's nominal effective exchange rate was aligned with predictions of where it should be, although experts are concerned about shift in foreign investor decision-making that will eliminate their dollar exchange risk.
  
  **Critical Thinking Questions:**
  1. What will the day-to-day repercussion of this devaluation look like for average civilians?
  2. How does the expected decline in the dollar's value align or disagree with current American administration?
  3. Why is it important for consumers to understand the repercussions of fiscal policy on their lives?
  4. What are other geopolitical factors that can cause depreciation in currencies around the world?
  5. What are some ways in which the American economy influences other markets?
  6. What are comparable scenarios that could have a similar effect on the global economy?
  7. How might multinational companies react to a decrease in dollar value?
  8. How can Americans show resilience throughout this change?
  9. In which ways can a decrease in local currency value impact tourism?
  10. What makes the foreign exchange market unique?
  11. Who benefits the most from the depreciation of the dollar?
  12. How can market psychology/a currency trader's perspective change the market for currency exchange?
  
  **Glossary:**
  - **Depreciation/Devaluation**: The decrease in the value of assets, and the method used to lower the cost of a tangible asset.
  - **Fiscal policy**: The spending programs and tax policies that the government uses to guide its economy, usually to achieve goals of increased economic growth, increased employment, and stable prices.
  - **Government deficit**: The balance of income and expenditure of government.
  - **Growth Gap**: The space between the current reality and the ideal growth.
  - **Tariffs**: Tax levied upon goods as they cross borders, usually by the government of the importing country.
  - **Public Debt**: Obligations of governments to pay sums to the holders at some future time.
  - **Nominal Exchange Rate**: The rate at which one currency can be exchanged for another in the market, essentially the price of a currency in terms of another.
  - **Nominal Effective Exchange Rate**: A form of measuring a country's nominal exchange rate relative to other currencies using an unadjusted weighted-average calculation.

  **From Platform to Product: Unilever's AI Transformation**
  
  What began as a military and geopolitical rivalry between the United States and China has evolved into a broader race for artificial intelligence dominance. Since the mid-2010s, the AI arms race has shifted from national security interests into a global competition for technological leadership. While governments continue to invest in advanced AI for strategic power, companies across sectors are now embedded in the same contest, fighting to innovate, scale, and stay relevant amongst their competitors.
  
  Unlike past industrial shifts, AI brings both speed and existential risk. The incentive to be the “first” has pushed firms to adopt AI aggressively. In the consumer goods sector, companies like Unilever are betting on digital transformation as their response to a high-stakes environment defined by rapid change.
  
  Unilever is a global consumer goods powerhouse with ownership in over 400 companies across personal care, foods, and home products including Dove, Ben & Jerry's, Hellmann's, and Axe. In 2025, Unilever partnered with Nvidia to implement digital twin technology, creating highly detailed 3D replicas of its products. These virtual versions are so accurate that every curve, color variation, and label in different languages can be simulated without prototyping a physical product. By uploading these digital twins into Nvidia’s Omniverse platform, Unilever has built a system where marketing content for product images or commercials can be generated entirely in a virtual environment.
  
  This move replaces the time-consuming process of shipping products to studios, staging photoshoots, and manually editing each visual. Instead, designers and marketers can now work together inside a shared digital space to make changes instantly. Changes include altering packaging for different regions and adapting visuals for e-commerce, social media, and broadcast ads.
  
  This partnership has resulted in significant impact. Unilever has reported up to an **87% reduction in content production costs** and a twofold increase in speed to market. Most importantly, the company can maintain strong visual consistency across its thousands of SKUs and global markets, ensuring that every product looks and feels like the same brand.
  
  Unilever’s digital twin strategy demonstrates how companies can stay relevant by aligning transformation with long-term business goals. AI’s potential can reimagine how value is created, delivered, and sustained. Businesses must act now to define their role in this new economy, making bold decisions and embedding them with intention.
  
  **Critical Thinking Questions:**
  1. How is AI reshaping global competition?
  2. In what ways is the race for AI dominance different from past technological revolutions?
  3. What responsibilities do companies have in ensuring ethical AI development and deployment during this rapid acceleration?
  4. How is AI changing the way brands interact with and understand their consumers?
  5. How does AI-generated marketing challenge traditional notions of authenticity and brand identity?
  6. How should companies define success in their AI adoptions (beyond just profit and efficiency)?
  7. How can smaller firms compete with giants like Unilever or Amazon in the AI space?
  8. In what ways are the AI race similar (and different) to historical arms races or industrial revolutions?
  9. How can companies determine whether an AI investment is truly transformative or just trend-following?
  10. Are companies underestimating the long-term societal impacts of rapid digital transformation?
  11. How does digital twin technology change the nature of creativity in marketing?
  12. What internal resistance might companies face when introducing digital twin models or similar AI systems?
  
  **Glossary:**
  - **AI Arms Race**: a global competition among countries & corporations to develop and deploy artificial intelligence technologies to gain strategic, economic, or technological advantage.
  - **Stock Keeping Unit (SKU)**: a unique identifier for each distinct product or service that can be purchased.
  - **Machine Learning**: a branch of artificial intelligence focused on enabling computers and machines to imitate the way that humans learn, to perform tasks autonomously, and to improve their performance and accuracy through experience and exposure to more data.
  - **Content Production Pipeline**: the structured process through which marketing content is created, edited, approved, and distributed.
  - **Operational Agility**: a company’s ability to rapidly adapt and respond to changes in the market or environment in an efficient and flexible manner.
  - **Sustainability Metrics**: measures used to track an organization’s environmental impact, such as carbon emissions, resource usage, and waste reduction.

  **How is AI Changing The Way We Learn Business English?**
  
  As the world becomes more connected, English is more than just a language, it is a career asset. For professionals in non-English speaking countries, proficiency can be the determining factor between international opportunities, broader negotiations and global networks which would otherwise remain inaccessible. 
  
  English is the language of global business, used in more than 70% of cross-border communication. Whether you are working in tech, finance, consulting or academia, your ability to lead and grow is heavily dependent on the capacity to express yourself in English. In meetings, calls, emails or presentations, confidence and clarity in English can be the dealbreaker between being local or global.
  
  And despite this, numerous technically skilled professionals are being held back, not by technical knowledge, but by modesty in using English. The issue is in competence. It is in belief.
  
  At Upward, we believe that English instruction is not sufficient to teach students about grammar. Language learning should empower individuals to express ideas clearly, navigate through cultural practices, and build long-term credibility with global colleagues and clients. English fluency isn’t merely about vocabulary or pronunciation. It’s about communicating leadership, professionalism and purpose.
  
  For French professionals, this issue is particularly strategic. As France advances in global industries such as AI, climate tech and consulting, professionals who master English position themselves to be ambassadors between worlds. They are able to lead international projects, serve cross-border clients and innovate beyond borders.
  
  With the competitive job market today, excellent English is no longer optional, it is expected. The good news? It is a skill that can be acquired. With proper guidance, hands on training and feedback, any business professional can acquire the confidence and proficiency needed to excel above and beyond.
  
  
  
  **Critical Thinking Questions:**
  1. Why is English considered a core skill for global professionals today?
  2. How might limited English affect cross-border deal-making?
  3. What are the cultural risks of communicating poorly in a second language?
  4. How can French professionals gain an edge in tech and ESG sectors with English?
  5. Why might confidence be more important than grammar in business communication?
  6. What role does English play in international client trust-building?
  7. How does English impact professional visibility on platforms like LinkedIn?
  8. Why should English learning be tailored to real work scenarios?
  9. What makes English more difficult to apply in spontaneous meetings vs. emails?
  10. How can English competence empower underrepresented voices globally?
  
  **Glossary:**
  1. **Cross-border communication** – communication between individuals or companies in different countries.
  2. **Remote collaboration** – working with others from different locations via digital tools.
  3. **Global fluency** – ability to navigate and communicate effectively across cultures.
  4. **Business English** – English language used in professional and corporate contexts.
  5. **Strategic communication** – purposeful use of communication by an organization to fulfill its mission.
  6. **Language barrier** – difficulty in communication due to differences in spoken language.

  **Beyond the Swoosh: Nike’s Strategy Amid U.S.-China Tariffs**
  
  In 1981, Nike entered the China market and by 2006, established Nike Sports (China) Co. Ltd. to oversee domestic operations. Rather than introducing new products for the China market, Nike sponsored various sporting events and professional leagues to broaden its presence, strategically taking part in China’s 2008 Olympic bid.
  
  With over 40 years of operations in the Greater China region, Nike’s recognition of interdependence between the U.S. and China becomes vital for global corporations to remain informed and develop sustainable strategies. As both a key manufacturing base and consumer market for Nike, China presents shifting risks and opportunities amid changing trade policies and political dynamics. Recent developments in the U.S.-China relations directly impact supply chain costs, market positioning, and long-term regional strategy of the consumer goods and footwear sector.
  
  As of early 2025, the United States, under its new administration, extended tariffs on Chinese imports, skyrocketing commercial taxation up to 145%. In retaliation, China set alternate rates of 125% and implemented more absolute regulations on overseas brands. While a May 2025 agreement temporarily lowered rates to 30% (U.S) and 10% (China) for 90 days, underlying business tensions lingered. Nike disclosed plans to decrease China-based production for US-based goods from 16% to single digits by 2026. This projects $1 billion in supplementary costs. Although alternative manufacturing centers like Vietnam and Mexico are expanding, this change demands thorough supply chain rearrangement, temporarily causing inefficiencies.
  
  Despite these manufacturing challenges, Nike remains a consistent partner with its international partner. The Chinese market, responsible for 15% of its FY2024 revenue of over $7.55 billion, faces intensifying competition from domestic rivals such as Anta and Li-Ning. As a result, the company plans on localized innovation to sustain market leadership. This commitment is exemplified by the promotion of Greater China CEO Angela Dong to lead global expansion of Nike's All Conditions Gear division. This strategic move positions China as a premium market and innovation hub for its global consumer base. This approach aligns with China's priorities of boosting domestic consumption and advancing technological autonomy.
  
  The interconnectedness of the two global economic hubs underscores the importance of informed, strategic, and adaptive decisions. China’s digitalization and modernization, especially in its retail and consumer goods sectors, positions itself as a vital part of Nike’s global strategy. With friction of uncertainty presents itself, Nike’s investment in regional leadership and local R&D to alleviate supply chain risks presents a competitive advantage in protecting long-term growth.
  
  
  **Critical Thinking Questions:**
  1. How would tariffs influence global supply chain strategies (for multinational companies like Nike)?
  2. How can political shifts in one country impact corporate decision-making worldwide?
  3. What challenges do companies face when they rely too much on one country for making their products?
  4. How can a global brand stay popular in a country where local competitors are getting stronger?
  5. Why is it important for multinational companies to invest in research and development within local markets?
  6. Why might a company invest in creating new products designed for just one country?
  7. How do large companies influence the communities where they set up factories?
  8. Why is it important for companies to understand the culture of the countries they sell to?
  9. How do global events change the way people shop for everyday items?
  10. What makes some companies better than others at adapting to change?
  11. What factors might cause a company to rethink its presence in a particular country?
  12. What ethical challenges arise when companies operate in multiple countries?

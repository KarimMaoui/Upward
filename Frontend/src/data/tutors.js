    bio: "Sophia is excited to bring to her many years of experience in online-tutoring and teaching English to her clients at Upward. Having studied Comparative Literature at the University of California, Berkeley, she is versed in advanced English and loves being able to share her knowledge and passion for the language with others. She believes good communication is key to establishing trust and rapport and that language is therefore essential for optimal professional relations. She particularly enjoys tailoring her lessons to help her students reach their unique goals and works hard to keep her lessons engaging and relevant to each student’s needs. Further, she is currently working towards Spanish-fluency in the medical field, and so has familiarity with the struggles of advanced language acquisition in a professional setting. This allows her to bring a level of sympathy and understanding of her students’ experience to her lessons.",

Lauren’s honors thesis focused on the experience of immigrants establishing community in the US during the 19th and early 20th century. She found she particularly resonated with the stories of Chinese immigrants, so she applied to a Fulbright English Teaching Assistantship to Taiwan. After completing her Fulbright grant, she continued her education at Stanford University where she studied East Asian Studies with a focus on Taiwanese literature and history. After taking a gap year to study more advanced Mandarin and Taiwanese on a Taiwanese government scholarship, Lauren returned to Stanford and completed her master's thesis on Japanese Colonial Literature in Taiwan. As a language learner herself, Lauren’s teaching philosophy centers on instilling her students with confidence to express themselves through gentle guidance and an upbeat attitude.",
